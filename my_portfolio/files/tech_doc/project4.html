                <p>HTML5 is the latest evolution of the standard that defines HTML. The term represents two different concepts. It is a new version of the language HTML, with new elements, attributes, and behaviors, and a larger set of technologies that allows the building of more diverse and powerful Web sites and applications. This set is sometimes called HTML5 &amp; friends and often shortened to just HTML5.</p>

                <br>
                <p>The HTML5 specification includes several semantic elements to help organize documents. Semantic elements are specifically designed to communicate meaning to the browser, developer, reader, and any other technologies interpreting the document (e.g. voice assistants).</p>
        
                <p>New semantic elements were added to HTML5 to improve the sectioning of websites. It is important for developers to not use these semantic elements other than their indicated purpose. Many accessibility tools rely on semantic HTML5 elements.</p>
                <br>
                <li><strong>HTML Section Element</strong> (&lt;section&gt;) defines a section of a document to indicate a related grouping of semantic meaning. Utilize the section element providing extra context from the parent element makes sense.</li>
            
                <li><strong>HTML Article Element</strong> (&lt;article&gt;) defines a piece of self-contained content. It does not refer to the main content alone and can be used for comments and widgets.</li>
                
                <li><strong>HTML Navigational Element</strong> (&lt;nav&gt;) defines a section that contains navigation links that appear often on a site. You can have primary and secondary menus, but you never nest, or put a &lt;nav&gt; element inside a &lt;nav&gt; element.</li>
                
                <li><strong>HTML Aside Element</strong> (&lt;aside&gt;) defines a section that, though related to the main element, doesn't belong to the main flow, like an explanation box or an advertisement. It has its own outline, but doesn't belong to the main one.</li>

                <br>
            
                <li><strong>HTML Body Element</strong> (&lt;body&gt;) defines all the content of a document. It contains all the content and HTML tags.</li>
                
                <li><strong>HTML Header Element</strong> (&lt;header&gt;) defines a page which typically contains the logo, title, and navigation. The header can also be used in other semantic elements such as &lt;article&gt; or &lt;section&gt; — or section header, containing perhaps the section's heading, author name, etc. &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;, and &lt;nav&gt; can have their own &lt;header&gt;. Despite its name, it is not necessarily positioned at the beginning of the page or section.</li>
                
                <li><strong>HTML Footer Element</strong> (&lt;footer&gt;) defines a page footer which typically contains the copyright, legal notices and sometimes some links — or section footer, containing perhaps the section's publication date, license information, etc. &lt;article&gt;>, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;, and &lt;nav&gt; can have their own &lt;footer&gt;. Despite its name, it is not necessarily positioned at the end of the page or section.</li>

            <header class="section-header">The Different Form Controls</header>
            <br>
            <p>The first article in our series provides your very first experience of creating a web form, including designing a simple form, implementing it using the right HTML elements, adding some very simple styling via CSS, and how data is sent to a server.</p>
            <p>With the basics out of the way, we now look in more detail at the elements used to provide structure and meaning to the different parts of a form.</p>
            
            <li><strong>Basic Native Form Controls</strong> We start off this section by looking at the functionality of the the original HTML &lt;input&gt; types in detail, looking at what options are available to collect different types of data.</li>
            
            <li><strong>The HTML5 Input Types</strong> Here we continue our deep dive into the &lt;input&gt; element, looking at the additional input types provided when HTML5 was released, and the various UI controls and data collection enhancements they provide. Additionally, we look at the &lt;output&gt; element.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Other Form Controls</strong> Next we take a look at all the non-&lt;input&gt; form controls and associated tools, such as &lt;select&gt;, &lt;textarea&gt;, &lt;meter&gt;, and &lt;progress&gt;.</li>

        <section id="Using_Built-in_Form_Validation" class="main-section">
            <header class="section-header">Using Built-in Form Validation</header>
            <br>
            <p>One of the most significant features of HTML5 form controls is the ability to validate most user data without relying on JavaScript. This is done by using validation attributes on form elements. We've seen many of these earlier in the course, but to recap:</p>
            <br>
            <li><code>required</code>: Specifies whether a form field needs to be filled in before the form can be submitted.</li> 
            <li><code>minlength</code> and <code>maxlength</code>: Specifies the minimum and maximum length of textual data (strings)</li>
            <li><code>min</code> and <code>max</code>: Specifies the minimum and maximum values of numerical input types</li>
            <li><code>type</code>: Specifies whether the data needs to be a number, an email address, or some other specific preset type.</li>
            <li><code>pattern</code>: Specifies a regular expression that defines a pattern the entered data needs to follow.</li>
            <p>If the data entered in an form field follows all of the rules specified by the above attributes, it is considered valid. If not, it is considered invalid.</p>

        <section id="Built-in_Form_Validation_Examples" class="main-section">
            <header class="section-header">Built-in Form Validation Examples</header>
            <br>
            <p>Let's start with a simple example: an input that allows you to choose whether you prefer a banana or a cherry. This example involves a simple text &lt;input&gt; with an associated &lt;label&gt; and a submit &lt;button&gt;. Find the source code on GitHub at fruit-start.html and a live example below.</p>
            <br>
            <code>
                <pre>
                    &lt;form&gt;
                    &lt;label for="choose"&gt;Would you prefer a banana or cherry?&lt;/label&gt;
                    &lt;input id="choose" name="i_like"&gt;
                    &lt;button&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
                    &lt;/form&gt;
                </pre>
            </code>
            <br>
            <code>
                <pre>
                    input:invalid {
                        border: 2px dashed red;
                    }

                    input:valid {
                        border: 2px solid black;
                    }
                </pre>
            </code>
            <p>If the data entered in an form field follows all of the rules specified by the above attributes, it is considered valid. If not, it is considered invalid.</p>
            <p>When an element is valid, the following things are true:</p>
            <li>The element matches the <code>:valid</code> CSS pseudo-class, which lets you apply a specific style to valid elements.</li>
            <li>If the user tries to send the data, the browser will submit the form, provided there is nothing else stopping it from doing so (e.g., JavaScript).</li>
            
            <p>When an element is invalid, the following things are true:</p>
            <li>The element matches the <code>:invalid</code> CSS pseudo-class, and sometimes other UI pseudo-classes (e.g., <code>:out-of-range</code>) depending on the error, which lets you apply a specific style to invalid elements.</li>
            <li>If the user tries to send the data, the browser will block the form and display an error message.</li>
